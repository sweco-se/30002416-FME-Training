# Exercise 3

Since you’ve started working with FME in your organization a lot of work has been automated. Your colleagues have been quite interested in it as well, and also try to use it! Obviously, they are not on your level yet and need some help.

**Assignment**:

Your co-worker is fairly new to FME and has created a workspace that they want you to have a look at. They’re overlaying historic aerial photographs with modern vector data, to visualize urbanization over the past 60 years. The results are fine, but the workspace seems to be taking an awfully long time to run.

Find the starting workspace at:

C:\FMEData2025\Workspaces\FMEFormAdvanced\exercise3\_start.fmw

Look though it and make sure you understand what the workspace does. Turn on feature caching, press run and go have a coffee (it’ll take a while).

When the workspace has finished running, look through the logfile and note the time it took. Then it’s competition time! Who in the room can get the time down by the biggest percentage?
