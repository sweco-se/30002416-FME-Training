#### About this document <a href="#about-this-document" id="about-this-document"></a>

This FME Form Advanced course is for users with some experience of FME Form. We assume you are familiar with the contents of the FME Form Basic course. In the exercises you will find words written in _Cursive._ These will help you out solving the questions. You can also look in the "tips" block. Bonus blocks will give you an extra task you can perform on the exercise if you have time left or want to test your skills. Blocks indicated with an "i" always give you some extra information.
