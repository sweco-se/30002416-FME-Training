# Exercise 6

Some of the users of the TiffClipper workspace are complaining that they don’t have a program to look at the results or that they don’t like to have to download the data all the time since it takes quite some space on their computer.

They’ve asked you to change up the self-service a little.

**Assignment**:

Publish the TiffClipper so that it is also available as a data streaming service and a Job submitter service.

* One workspace can run with several different services.
* Do some services require different settings?
* Do you need to change the workspace to ensure it works?
* When in doubt, feel free to run the workspace on FME Flow.
