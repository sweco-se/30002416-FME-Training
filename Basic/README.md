### About this document

This FME Form Basic course is for users with little to no experience of FME Form. In the exercises you will find words written in _Cursive._ These will help you out solving the questions. You can also look in the "tips" block. Bonus blocks will give you an extra task you can perform on the exercise if you have time left or want to test your skills. Blocks indicated with an "i" always give you some extra information.
